        # in ascending order.  We set swapped to True if a swap occurs, which
        # tells us the list was not yet sorted at the beginning of this pass.
        # We initially have the counter variable go from 0,length-2, the 
        # 2nd last index of the list. This is because the last item in the
        # list has no item at j+1. With each pass through the list the
        # next largest item in the list will have been shifted down to 
        # its correct position in the sorted list. i.e. after the first pass
        # through the list the largest item will be in the last index of 
        # the list, after the second pass through the list the second 
        # largest item will be in the second last index of the list, and
        # so on.  We don't need to perform any comparisons with the these 
        # last items because we already know they are in the correct positino.
        # So we have length - i - 1, subtracting i, for the end of the 
        # range, so that we go one less item deep into the list each time
        # with each pass as i goes from 0,1,2,... and on in the outer loop.
