    # mark characters.  This optional third argument will have all the characters
    # of this string (string.punctuation) removed from text.

    # numbers like '9' to be considered a word.  So we take this list and use
    # it in a list comprehension, where we produce a new list containing only
    # the original list items that are ONLY made up of alphabetic characters.
    # The isalpha() string method will only return true if the string is only
    # made up of alphabetic characters, and so we use this to do the filtering.

# NOT consider portions of the string in-between whitespace characters to be 
# words IF they contain non-alphabetic characters.
