    # iterate over each item in the list (which we call 'number').  We use

    # if the number divided by 2 gives us a remainder of 0.  Only if the number
    # is even do we increment a running count of the number of even numbers 
    # in the list (total_even).  By the time the loop is done we will have 
    # counted all the even numbers in the list and we then return that count.
