# length of our binary number.  These numbers in the range 0, 1, ..., 5 in 
# the case of 101011 will be exactly the exponents of the powers of 2 for 
# each digit in our binary number.
#
# With each loop iteration, we pop off the LAST digit in the list, so for the 
# list ['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '1'] we'll pop off 1, then 1, then 0, and so 
# on.  We then check if the digit is 1.  If it is, we get the weight of that 
# digit using pow(2, i), where i the exponent of the power of 2 for that 
# digit, and we add that weight to the decimal number we are creating.
#
# When the loop is done we will have added the weight of all the relevant 
# digits to decimal and the sum and conversion will be complete.
