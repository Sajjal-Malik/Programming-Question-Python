# Program works by keeping a running count of the number of even numbers and 
# odd numbers found in the variables even_count and odd_count.  An even number
# has a remainder of 0 when divided by 1, an odd number has a remainder of 1
# when divided by 2.  So we have a for loop iterate over each number in the list
# where with each loop iteration 'number' will be set to the next number in 
# the list.  We then divide the number by 2 using the modulus operator % which
# provides the remainder of a division operation. And in the if branch we 
# check to see if the remainder is 0 which would tell us we have an even number
# and we increment even_count to acknowledge we have found another even number,
# and if this is not the case then in the elif branch we check to see if 
# dividing the number by 2 gives us a remainder of 1 which would tell us we have
# an odd number and we increment odd_count to acknowledge that we have found 
# another odd number.  By the time the loop is done we will have counted all 
# the even and odd numbers in the list.
