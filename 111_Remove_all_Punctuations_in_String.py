# characters in a string.  To make the translation table, we pass in empty 
# strings for the first two arguments as we don't need to replace any characters
# in the string (and that is what these arguments can help do), but we do pass 
# the optional 3rd argument... a string of all the characters to remove, in 
# this case, string.punctuation (i.e. all the punctuation marks).  The 
# translate method will produce a new string.
